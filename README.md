# Data-Analysis-Project-1
For crucial reasons, the stock and quarterly revenue for organisations is analysed. Therefore, I will take on the position of a data scientist and or data analyst working for a hedge fund tasked with the action of extracting the stock and revenue data from some prestigious companies â€” namely: Tesla and GameStop, to gain insights and understanding of evolution and trends of the stock and revenue in the share market over a significant period of time. I'll also visualise this data in a dashboard with the aid of a graph.
